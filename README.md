# Weather App

This project was made as part of a technical assessment for PM Accelerator. It uses Typescript/React through Vite. Weather and geocoding information is provided by [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) APIs.

## Setup

Make you sure have the following installed
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (version 20.x or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (package managers).


Install required dependencies using npm or yarn
```
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Obtain a free API key for [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api). Create a copy of `.env.example` named `.env` in the root directory and fill in your API key.

Now you can start a development version by running
```
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
````

Optionally, you can instead create a production build:
```
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```
and preview it
```
npm run preview
# or
yarn preview
```
